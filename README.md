## Classification of TED Talks into Tags

#### Project to classify TED talks into different tags using their transcripts. This is a multiclass classification problem due to the large number of possible tags for each video. We use only the top 50 tags with the highest frequency of occurence. The problem is solved as a one-vs-all problem for each of the tags.
